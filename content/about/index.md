EMRE DÜNDAR

Dündar was born in İstanbul. He started playing the piano at an early age. During the early years of his youth, he continued to work in music as well as in painting; he studied in Mehmet Güleryüz’s workshop for six years, participated in many solo and group exhibitions. He studied opera performance, piano, conducting, and composition at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University.

During 2000-2002, he conducted Eskişehir Symphony Orchestra and worked as its art director. He won Ministry of Culture’s National Composers Contest in the year 2004.

From 2000 and on, he gave lectures on music theory and orchestration at Yıldız Technical University Design Faculty, Eskişehir Anadolu University State Conservatory, and Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University State Conservatory. During this period, he has also participated in many events as soloist and chamber music pianist.

In 2016 he was selected as finalist in Basel Composition Competition.

The composer creates works using the acoustic and electro-acoustic mediums and utilizes many of the prominent techniques and tendencies of particularly the second half of the 20th century in various contexts.

The composer has a deep interest for the musical value and counterparts of the act of speaking-telling, and frames his musical language around the notion of “narration”, focusing on ancient rhetorical traditions in particular. He establishes the expressive contexts of his works on the basis of different forms taken by the concept of narration during its journey throughout the history and on various possible applications of the act of “narration”. In this sense, poetry and formal problems of poetry have a direct impact on the composer’s musical language.
