**CREATIVE AND RESEARCH INTERESTS**

Language-music relation is an endless data field for a composer. Dündar spent most of his life in Istanbul, where many languages intersect/collide mostly within sorrowful and tragic contexts. Composer collects sonic memories -“language prints”- he gathers from several languages that he has heard throughout his life and incorporates them into his music.

To the extent of such direction composer holds a deep interest for musical value and counterparts of the act of speaking-telling in music, therefore builds his musical language around the notion of “narration”, focusing on ancient rhetorical traditions in particular. He establishes expressive contexts of his works on the basis of different forms taken by the concept of narration during its journey throughout history and on various possible applications of the act of “narration”. In this sense, poetry and formal problems of poetry have a direct impact on the composer’s musical language.

**PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES**

Dündar as a performer/improviser regularly takes part in various projects. Improvisation practice influences artist’s composing act. According to Dündar, who improvises with a wide variety of instruments including his own voice as well as various keyboards (prepared pianos, spinets, piano accordions, synths, etc.), the act of improvisation serves as a database that providing a direct source for his composing. Accordingly, he articulates/adjoins outcomes of his studies on improvisation transcription and related notation problems to his composition technique.
